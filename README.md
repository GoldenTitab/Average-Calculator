# 🧮 Average Calculator (Tkinter)

This is a simple GUI-based Python application that calculates the **average** of numbers entered by the user. It's built using the `tkinter` library.

## 📌 Features

- Takes a list of numbers separated by space
- Calculates the average
- Displays the result in a user-friendly interface
- Option to clear the input and result

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x).
2. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python average_calculator.py
```

> Replace `average_calculator.py` with the actual filename if different.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The user inputs space-separated numbers (e.g., `10 20 30`).
- The app splits the input, converts each to an integer, and calculates the average.
- Result is shown below the buttons.
- The **Clear** button resets the input field and result label.

## 🛠 Built With

- Python 🐍
- Tkinter (standard GUI toolkit for Python)
